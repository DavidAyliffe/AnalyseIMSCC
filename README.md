# AnalyseIMSCC
An open source Perl script to analyse IMSCC files created by Educational Learning Management Systems (e.g. Schoology)

This script will take a backup archive produced by an LMS (Moodle, Canvas, Schoology, Edmodo) and re-create the folder structure on the local file system.  The name of the project could be considered to be slightly misleading since the script does not actually analyse IMSCC files

Issues can be reported to: github@ayliffe.com or ayliffe.david@gmail.com
